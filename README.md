# Stupid Inventions
A multiplayer in browser game to help improving presentation skills.
## Setup
Needs a populated mongo database. To connect to your db add a `.env` file in  `/server`  and according to the specifications of `.env.example` in the same folder. Then move to `/server/populateDb` and run `populateDb.js` to add all necessary data.

Tests can be used by running `npm t` in either the server or client folders.
